# Load the passenger data


# Update sex column to numerical


# Fill the nan values in the age column


# Create a first class column


# Create a second class column


# Select the desired features


# Perform train, test, split


# Scale the feature data so it has mean = 0 and standard deviation = 1


# Create and train the model


# Score the model on the train data


# Score the model on the test data


# Analyze the coefficients


# Sample passenger features
Jack = np.array([0.0,20.0,0.0,0.0])
Rose = np.array([1.0,17.0,1.0,0.0])
# You = np.array([___,___,___,___])

# Combine passenger arrays


# Scale the sample passenger features


# Make survival predictions!
